// File: DistPower.cpp
// 
// Contains the functions for Power Distribution functions of the PowerGrid class
// 
// These functions implement algorithms for analyzing demand, capacity, 
// grid topology, efficiency, and environmental impact to satisfy power
// demands.

// The algorithm is to repeatedly loop through each demand location and check if it has
// outstanding power requirements.  If so, it calls the tryToAllocatePower function.  That
// function searches for a power plant with power, uses the next available transmission line 
// and supplies power from the plant to the demand location. 
//
// There are 3 conditions that cause  the algorithm to terminate:
//  1) All demand locations have all their power requirements completly fulfilled
//  2) The power plants have allocated all of their power so no more can be fulfilled
//  3) The transmission lines are saturated  so they cannot carry and additional power.
//

// conditions becomes true.
